- Move manual test to root-level
- Add + function for datasets
- Unit test for scatter_plot
- Design different DataSet classes (for variable length, regression etc)
- Write protected DataSet (properties don't seem two work with list-indexing)
  Totally write protected data doesn't seem useful?
- How to handle copy-ing (for example in a cross-validation Node?)
- Automated tests for derivatives of Node
